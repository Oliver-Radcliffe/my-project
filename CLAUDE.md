# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a simple git repository without a specific framework or language setup. The project structure is flexible and can be extended based on development needs.

## Common Commands

### Git Operations
- Initialize repository: `git init` (already done)
- Check status: `git status`
- Create commits: `git add <files> && git commit -m "message"`
- View history: `git log --oneline`

## Architecture

This is a blank slate repository. Project architecture will emerge as code is added.

When adding code to this repository:
- Create appropriate directory structure based on the language/framework chosen
- Add build/test/lint commands to this file as they become relevant
- Document any architectural decisions or patterns adopted
